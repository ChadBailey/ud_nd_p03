# level_maker.py made by Chad Bailey 4-15-2017

# Level maker utility for making levels for game.py
#
# Purpose: Udacity intro to Programming Nanodegree, 3rd project
#
# Objective: This is a simple level maker utility to create levels to be used by the application.
#
# Notice: This level maker is a complete bonus and not a requirement of the project. Therefore 
# certain criteria have not been met. For example, I have not abstracted
# out anything into functions. While I normally do this for everything I design, this particular
# application I did not feel it made sense to do so due to the way it flowed.
